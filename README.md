# Earnings Intelligence System

> LLM-powered trade signal extraction from SEC earnings filings: reads what 
> companies *say*, not just what their stock *does*.

## What It Does

Most trading systems react to price. This one reads language.

The system pulls 8-K earnings filings directly from the SEC EDGAR API, runs 
them through an LLM (Claude Haiku), and extracts a structured trade signal: 
sentiment, confidence score, bull/bear case, risk flags, management tone, and 
guidance quality. Signals are backtested against historical price data and 
visualized in a full-stack dashboard.

**No paid data feeds. No Bloomberg terminal. Just the SEC's free public API 
and an LLM that can read.**

## Results

Backtested on 35 trades across 10 tickers (2024-2026), buying bullish signals
with confidence >= 0.6 at the filing-date close and selling 5 trading days later:

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Trades | 35 |
| Win Rate | 45.7% |
| Avg Return per Trade | -0.9% |
| Total Return | -35.9% |
| SPY Benchmark (same period) | +27.2% |
| Sharpe Ratio | -0.71 |
| Max Drawdown | -64.8% |

Naive equal-weight sizing produces the drawdown shown. Current work:
transaction-cost modeling and Kelly-criterion position sizing.

## Dashboard

The React dashboard provides five views:

- **Overview**: dataset stats, sentiment distribution, recent signal feed
- **Signals**: full signal table with ticker filter, confidence bars, sentiment badges
- **Signal Detail**: LLM reasoning, bull/bear case, risk flags, raw filing viewer
- **Backtest**: equity curve, Sharpe/drawdown stats, performance summary, full trade ledger
- **Portfolio**: paper trading view (Phase 4)

The hosted demo renders from a static snapshot of this exact dataset (exported
by `scripts/export_demo_data.py` and bundled with the frontend build), so it
does not depend on a live backend. When a live API is configured and reachable,
the dashboard uses it instead; if the API stops responding, the dashboard falls
back to the snapshot and shows a "cached data" badge.

## Setup

```bash
# Clone and enter
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/earnings-intel.git
cd earnings-intel

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1      # Windows
source .venv/bin/activate        # Mac/Linux

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Add your API key
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
```

## Usage

```bash
# Fetch filings for a ticker
python main.py AAPL --filings 6

# Run LLM signal extraction
python main.py AAPL --analyze

# Run backtest
python main.py --backtest

# Start the dashboard
# Terminal 1:
uvicorn api.main:app --reload

# Terminal 2:
cd dashboard && npm install && npm run dev
# Open http://localhost:5173
```

## Key Design Decisions

**Why 8-K filings instead of earnings call transcripts?**  
8-Ks are free via SEC EDGAR. Transcripts require paid APIs (Refinitiv, etc.). 
This system achieves comparable signal quality at zero data cost.

**Why Claude Haiku over GPT-4?**  
Haiku costs ~$0.002/filing vs ~$0.02 for GPT-4o-mini, enabling backtest runs 
across 500+ historical events without significant API spend.

**Why show negative backtest results?**  
Because they're real. A strategy that shows perfect returns on first run is 
almost always overfit. The honest result is the starting point for iteration.

## What's Next

- Confidence threshold sweep (0.6 → 0.8 → 0.9) to find the signal subset that works
- Guidance quality filter (only trade "strong" or "raised" guidance signals)
- Phase 4: Alpaca paper trading for live autonomous execution
- Expand to 20+ tickers for statistically robust backtesting
